synopsis:      Haskell on Gtk rails - Generic View for MVC applications
description:
  Keera Hails is a rapid application development system.
  .
  The idea behind Hails is that you should be able to build cross platform
  applications with minimal effort, very quickly, and the result should be easy
  to maintain.
  .
  Large Hails applications are structured following an optimized MVC
  architecture. Values are updated either from the view to the model, or from
  the model to the view. Internally, rules use a notion of direction in the
  update to determine how different components must be updated.
  .
  This library provides a generic interface that can be used by applications to
  abstract details about views needed to synchronize the view with the model.
