-- /Reactive Values/ (RVs) are typed mutable variables with a change
-- notification mechanism. They are defined by providing a way to /read/ the
-- value, a way to /change/ it, and a way to install an /react/ when the value
-- has changed.
--
-- RVs are abstract (i.e., a type class). This module defines a class and
-- manipulation operations, but you need an actual instance of RV underneath.
-- For a way to turn 'IORef's into RVs, see the example below. GUI toolkits can
-- use existing event-handling mechanisms to make widget attributes Reactive
-- Values without additional boilerplate. A number of
-- <https://github.com/keera-studios/keera-hails backends> (GUIs, devices,
-- files, network, FRP) are supported.
--
-- RVs are complemented with /Reactive Relations/, which connect RVs and keep
-- them /in sync/ during execution.
--
-- A very simple example of an RV is the following construction, in
-- which passive IORefs are turned into active Reactive Values.

-- $rvs
--
-- Reactive Values are an abstraction over values that change over the execution
-- of a program, and whose change we can be aware of.
--
-- There is no unique, canonical implementation of RVs: they are defined as
-- a collection of type classes, and you are free to make your existing
-- framework reactive by providing the necessary instances.
--
-- RVs are distinguished by the API they offer, mainly whether it is possible
-- to read them, to write to them, or both. A /readable/ RV is one that whose
-- value we can read (whether it is read-only or read-write, or whether it will
-- actively propagate changes to it or not, is a different matter). Analogously,
-- a /writable/ RV is one that we can write to (write-only or read-write).
--
-- We also distinguish between /active/ RVs (i.e., those that actively propagate
-- changes through the Reactive Relations they are connected to) and /passive/
-- RVs (those that do not propagate changes). It is possible to "silence" an
-- RV by minimizing unnecesssary change, or attaching it to another RV that
-- determines when change propagates (see governing and guarding below).

-- $readablervs
--
-- Readable reactive values are mutable values that can be read and, possibly,
-- trigger notifications when they change.
--
-- RVs without event handling are considered /passive/. That is their default
-- behaviour if 'reactiveValueOnCanRead' is not specialised.
-- BEWARE: Active and passive RVs are not differentiated at the type level.
--
-- You are responsible of installing any potential thread-safety
-- mechanisms when you implement instances, and to ensure that operations
-- are executed in the right thread (some GUI toolkits may require that).
-- It is important that the way that ensured that monadic actions are
-- executed in the right thread can be nested; otherwise, some propagation can
-- block.

-- | A class for all Readable RVs. They can be read-only or read-write.
--
-- If your type is also writeable (a writable RV or simply if it is not
-- constant), you can include a change handler installer here. By default
-- no change handlers are installed.
--
-- Use a monad with "error" if reading or installing a handler can fail.
class Monad m => ReactiveValueRead a b m | a -> b, a -> m where

  -- | Install a handler that will be executed when the reactive value
  -- changes.
  reactiveValueOnCanRead :: a -> m () -> m ()
  reactiveValueOnCanRead _ _ = return ()

  -- | Provide the last known value for this reactive value.
  reactiveValueRead :: a -> m b

  {-# MINIMAL reactiveValueRead #-}

-- | Monadic actions are readable, but they do not provide any change
-- notification.
instance ReactiveValueRead (IO a) a IO where
  -- | Executes the monadic action and provides a value.
  reactiveValueRead = id

-- | Pairs carrying a monadic action as their first component are Readable RVs.
instance (Functor m, Monad m) => ReactiveValueRead (m a, a -> m b) a m where
  reactiveValueRead = fst

-- $writablervs
--
-- Writable reactive values are those that we can write to. They behave like
-- sinks: there are no guarantees that anything happens, or result codes.
--
-- You are responsible of installing any potential thread-safety mechanisms
-- when you implement instances, and to ensure that operations are executed in
-- the right thread (some GUI toolkits may require that). It is important that
-- the way that ensured that monadic actions are executed in the right thread
-- can be nested; otherwise, some propagation can block.

-- | A minimal type class for all mutable values. Use a monad with error if
-- changing the value can fail.
class ReactiveValueWrite a b m | a -> b, a -> m where
  reactiveValueWrite :: a -> b -> m ()

-- | Monadic actions are trivially writable RVs in that monad, by ignoring the
-- argument and executing the action. This is particularly suitable for IO code
-- that just runs an action when a given value changes.
instance ReactiveValueWrite (IO a) () IO where
  reactiveValueWrite m _ = void m

-- | Monadic actions parameterised over an input are trivially writable RVs in
-- that monad. This is particularly suitable for IO code that just runs an
-- action when a given value changes, using that value.
instance (Functor m, Monad m) => ReactiveValueWrite (a -> m b) a m where
  reactiveValueWrite f v = void (f v)

-- | To facilitate creating RW reactive values from monadic actions, pairs
-- of a getter and a setter are also RVs.
instance ReactiveValueWrite (a -> m b) a m
      => ReactiveValueWrite (m a, a -> m b) a m
  where
    reactiveValueWrite (_, f) = reactiveValueWrite f

-- $readwritervs
--
-- RVs can be readable and writable, which is useful to create bi-directional
-- rules (combinators like '(=:=)' require this instance).
--

-- | Read-write Reactive Values are trivially defined. This class only captures
-- the constraints of both the other classes. There is no need to implement any
-- methods.
class (ReactiveValueRead a b m, ReactiveValueWrite a b m)
   => ReactiveValueReadWrite a b m

-- | Pairs of a monadic action and a parametric monadic action are also RVs
instance (Functor m, Monad m) => ReactiveValueReadWrite (m a, a -> m b) a m

-- $activatable
--
-- Activatable RVs are values that never hold any data, but whose change (or
-- activation, or some sort of internal event) we need to be aware of).

-- | A class for things with a trivial field that carries unit. Buttons (in any
-- GUI library), for instance, could be a member of this class.
class ReactiveValueActivatable m a where
   defaultActivation :: a -> ReactiveFieldActivatable m

-- $rules
--
-- Reactive Rules are data dependency (data-passing) building combinators. By
-- executing them, you install the right event handlers on the right RVs, so
-- that values pass to the other RV.
--
-- Reactive Relations cannot be independently removed. If the event-dispatching
-- is handled internally by RVs, and two connected RVs are removed, then the
-- rules should also disappear with them.

-- $changecontrol

-- Sometimes you need to create complex liftings between RVs in which only
-- changes to one of them should provoke change propagation. These combinators
-- allow you to stop propagation (making RVs passive), make one RV control the
-- change propagation of another (governance), filter propagation based on some
-- condition (guards) and have a boolean-carrying RV guard another.

-- Turning an active RV into a passive one (does not propagate changes). Note
-- that this does not really affect the RV itself, only produces a new RV that
-- will not propagate changes. So, if used in a reactive relation, values will
-- not get propagated when they change. It is useful in combination with lifts,
-- to achieve things similar to Yampa's tagging, but this might be more
-- general.
